Net-G is a daemon that will send system network information such as IP addresses to the user via a Gmail account.

This is useful when it necessary to know a device's IP address but static IPs and dynamic DNS are not an option, e.g. college campus, other shared network.

The daemon is written in C++ and the script that emails the information is written in Python 3.
